Please see the main repo for more information on the FredBoat project: [https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat)

This repository is home to FredBoat's internal database backend. At this point, this is not a public API of any sorts.
Any documentation found here is aimed at FreBoat developers. Future development of the API might include additional, semi-public services.


## Versions

The API is currently versioned as v0, which is a straight port of the existing database operations.  
The endpoints are split up by [existing entities](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/tree/dev/Database/src/main/java/fredboat/db/entity).

The plans for v1 and future versions include:
- proper usage of http verbs (GET, DELETE, PATCH, etc)
- decoupling from the internal entity model, instead granular calls
- a success/error layer
- end-user access and authorization

### v1 [WIP]

The v1 Quarterdeck docs can be found [here](https://koakuma.fredboat.com/qd/swagger-ui.html).  
It includes running test queries in the browser against a live testing deployment of Quarterdeck. 
If you are a developer who wants to build apps based on FredBoat's backend, please read the document 
[linked below](#contributing) to learn how to join our community, where you can request credentials to access
our testing environment.

### v0

The existing entity endpoints are:
- /blacklist
- /guildconfig
- /guilddata
- /guildmodules
- /guildperms
- /prefix
- /searchresult

Each entity endpoint supports the following operations:
- POST /fetch
- POST /merge
- POST /delete

`fetch` and `delete` require the id to be sent, `merge` the entity itself.  

Some entity endpoints have additional calls:
- Blacklist:
  - GET /loadall

- Prefix:
  - POST /getraw

- Search result:
  - POST /getmaxaged

The entity endpoints are reachable behind the version path, for example:
```
GET http[s]://backend.url[:port]/v0/blacklist/loadall
```


There is an additional endpoint, that will return the supported versions of the API:
- GET /info/api/versions

Authentication happens via [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).  
No kind of authorization is existent, you either have access, or you don't. In terms of security, treat this the same way you would treat a redis instance.  


## Building And Testing Quarterdeck

To make a build, including running tests, do:
```
./gradlew build
```

To run tests against our postgres database, Quarterdeck requires docker and docker-compose installed, as well an 
unoccupied port `5433`.

When running tests repeatedly on a development machine you can shave off some time by passing a property 
to keep the postgres container alive between tests:

```
./gradlew test -DkeepPostgresContainer=true
```

or setting it via IntelliJ IDEA's run/debug config as a VM option:
[![Setting the keep postgres container property with IntelliJ IDEA's run/debug config](https://fred.moe/rBL.png)] 

Keep in mind that in that case you will have to manually shut down the container to get rid of it:

```
docker stop quarterdecktest_db_1
docker rm quarterdecktest_db_1
```
